## Appendix 1 - Supporting information for Chapter 2

**Supporting Table S2.3 Full reference list for generation of phylogeny.** The taxa included are those 659 species that could not be attached to the phylogeny directly. 161 species were attached as unambiguous synonyms (via WCVP information). The remaining 497 species were either attached directly to a node if they were the only other species of the same genus, the only member of a genus, or if a clear location for the species could reasonably be inferred from previous phylogenetic studies. 151 species could not be assigned a clear location in the phylogeny and were not attached. The action taken to assign each species a position in the phylogeny is explained in column ‘Attachment rationale’. Phylogenetic information sources are referenced in column ‘Citation for phylogeny’. ITS_corrected refers to the unpublished phylogeny shared with me by Max R Brown and Alex Twyford. 

**Supporting Table S2.4 CSR scores calculated using the method by Pierce *et al.*, 2017.** Columns describing taxon_name and kew_id correspond to BIFloraExplorer accessions, C_num, S_num and R_num describe the competitor, stress-tolerator and ruderal scores (out of 100), and predicted_CSR shows the final category the species is classed into, according to Grime's (1974) CSR strategies and as imputed with the method by Pierce *et al.*, 2017. Only species with full data coverage are included (1,441 species).

**Supporting Method S2.1 Phylogenetic tree of BI species as TREE file.** 2,501 tips.
